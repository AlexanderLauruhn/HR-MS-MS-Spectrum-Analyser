# HR-MS-MS-Spectrum-Analyser
This software removes those signals from a high-resolution tandem mass spectrum, which are mathematically clearly identifyable as false-positive signals, probable caused by impurities in the sample or by incorrect calibration of the instrument.
# How to use the software
Open your mass spectrum using the button "import File". This should by available as .txt or .csv file. The spectrum will be shown as plot on the screen.<br>
After that, type the molecular sum of your target compound, set the measurementÂ´s ionisation (positive or negative).
